  "summary": "decent.land is a suite of protocols for identity and social - ANS (Arweave Name Service), Ark, and the Public Square Protocol can be used as a stack or alone to add social graphs/metadata, identity, and token-gating functionality to dApps. Ark is a multichain identity linking protocol, integrated with Avalanche, and a key part of the decent.land stack. With Ark, it's possible for a user to link their Arweave identity to addresses on different chains and prove ownership of tokens / membership of DAOs to any dApp regardless of the chain the dApp was built on.",
